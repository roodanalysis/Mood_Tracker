## Mood Tracker :performing_arts:
An actively updated dataset containing factors that may be influencing my mood on a daily basis.


This is a pet project of mine, and it's been great to hold me accountable for being consistent with something on a daily basis, such as getting an adequate amount of sleep, exercising, meditating, and making sure to have three square meals a day. 
There are some other factors in here that I thought would be interesting to include, such as time with partner, family, or social interaction. 
I update this frequently and I make sure to adjust my habits accordingly to ensure I wake up neutral or above every day! 


### Some context of the data: 

I have 5 moods (from worst to best): Despondent, Discouraged, Neutral, Happy, and Elated. 
I chose these moods specifically because I felt the most comfortable with them. I believe "Sad" or "Angry" may need more context than I can provide in a dataset. Despondent being the absolute worst seemed fitting, while discouraged being the next best thing felt right to me. Some days, you can wake up stressed, overwhelmed, discouraged. It doesn't necessarily mean "I am sad", but a more gentle synonym. 
The same thing goes for neutral. It's not bad, it's not great. It's "I just woke up, I don't really know what I'm feeling" yet. It could be swayed either way- but, it has always turned upward so far.

Thanks for reading! Stay tuned! :smile: :chart_with_upwards_trend:
